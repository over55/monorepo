This file is empty, but if you would like to add ip addresses to ban then do the following:

1. Create a new file called `ips.json`.

2. Open that file and your ip addresses using this JSON style: ``{"192.168.1.1","192.168.1.2","192.168.1.3"}``

3. Rebuild your docker container and deploy. You are done.
